I apologize, emissary, but the prince is away on an errand. What brings you to this desolate place?

By royal edict, you men are to return to Lordaeron immediately. Lord Uther has convinced the king to recall this expedition.

We're to just pick up and leave?

That's correct. My men report that the roads from here to the shore are held by the undead. You'll need to find an alternate route back to your ships.

Uther had my troops recalled? Damn it! If my warriors abandon me, I'll never defeat Mal'Ganis. The ships must be burned before the men reach the shore!
