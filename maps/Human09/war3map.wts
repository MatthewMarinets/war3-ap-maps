You lied to your men and betrayed the mercenaries who fought for you. What's happening to you, Arthas? Is vengeance all that's important to you?

Spare me, Muradin. You weren't there to see what Mal'Ganis did to my homeland.

The Dark Lord said you would come. This is where your journey ends, boy. Trapped and freezing at the roof of the world, with only death to sing the tale of your doom.

The only way to counter Mal'Ganis' power is to find the mysterious runeblade known as Frostmourne and bend its powers to your will. Though the cost may be high, only Frostmourne's power will ensure that justice is done.
}

So, you've taken up Frostmourne at the expense of your comrades' lives, just as the Dark Lord said you would. You're stronger than I thought.

Hold, lad. There's an inscription on the dais. It's a warning. It says, "Whomsoever takes up this blade shall wield power eternal. Just as the blade rends flesh, so must power scar the spirit." Oh, I should've known. The blade is cursed! Let's get the hell out of here!
