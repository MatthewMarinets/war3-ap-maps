The only way to counter Mal'Ganis' power is to find the mysterious runeblade known as Frostmourne and bend its powers to your will. Though the cost may be high, only Frostmourne's power will ensure that justice is done.

Hold, lad. There's an inscription on the dais. It's a warning. It says, "Whomsoever takes up this blade shall wield power eternal. Just as the blade rends flesh, so must power scar the spirit." Oh, I should've known. The blade is cursed! Let's get the hell out of here!
