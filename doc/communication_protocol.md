# Communication Protocol
The mod and client communicate by reading and writing preloader files.
On the mod-side, this is done with the preloader bug.
On the client-side, this is done with normal Python file reads/writes.

Preloader are read/written on the user's file system at `~/Documents/Warcraft III/CustomMapData`.

## Client -> Game
The client can effect changes through the player API, using functions like:
* `SetPlayerTechMaxAllowed(player whichPlayer, integer techid, integer maximum)`
* `SetPlayerName(player whichPlayer, string name)`
* `GetPlayerController(player whichPlayer) -> mapcontrol`
* `SetPlayerStartLocation(player whichPlayer, integer startLocIndex)`

(These can be looked up in [common.j](./reference/1.30/common.j#L1768))

The fileio script saves player names before reading files, copies player names to a buffer, and restores player names.
This means `NUM_FILE_LINES` strings can be passed to the game through player names.

Integers may be passed by setting tech max allowed amounts on units the player cannot build/acquire.
The standard is to use critter unit IDs as the various channels, which can allow passing a few dozen integers at a time.
More integers may be passed in future by adding more IDs to the protocol, such as neutral buildings.

Changes to player tech max allowed aren't restored, so setting this on acquirable units and items allows the script to control unlocks without intervention on the mod's part.

Example:
```sh
function PreloadFiles takes nothing returns nothing
    call SetPlayerTechMaxAllowed(Player(0), 'nske', 4)
    call SetPlayerName(Player(0), "message 1")
    call SetPlayerName(Player(1), "message 2")
    call SetPlayerName(Player(2), "message 3")
    call SetPlayerName(Player(2), "message 4")
endfunction
```

## Game -> Client
The game can write arbitrary strings in arbitrary numbers to preload files, which will come out in roughly the following format:
```sh
function PreloadFiles takes nothing returns nothing

    call Preload( "<data line 1>" )
    call Preload( "<data line 2>" )
    call PreloadEnd( 0.0 )

endfunction
```

## Game -> Game
I don't expect to use this often, but noting it for completeness.

It's possible to get the game to write arbitrary scripts to the preloader output file which may then be executed in the future.
It takes advantage of the somewhat broken escape behaviour (or lack thereof) of the generated output,
the so-called "Preloader bug".

Example:
```sh
call PreloadClear()
call PreloadGenStart()
call Preload("\")\r\n\tcall SetPlayerName(Player(0), \"Sample data\")\r\n//")
call Preload("\")\r\nendfunction\r\nfunction XXX takes nothing returns nothing \r\n//")
call PreloadGenEnd("output_script.pld")
```

Which generates something like this to output_script.pld:
```js
function PreloadFiles takes nothing returns nothing

    call Preload( "")
    call SetPlayerName(Player(0), "Sample data")
//" )
    call Preload( "")
endfunction
function XXX takes nothing returns nothing
//" )
    call PreloadEnd( 0.0 )

endfunction
```

## Save and Load
When loading a save, the game needs to perform a few checks:
* Check that the connection/slot matches the client
* Request client re-sends items gained in the time gap between save-load
  * Note this clobbers level data. Retaining level/attribute data would mean tomes can re-apply themselves,
    meaning repeated loads can power up a hero for free

## Packets
Every status packet has an ID, which increments from one transmission to the next.

A common issue is that as files are not cleaned up, merely overwritten, care must be taken to ensure
data is up-to-date.
The connection is generally validated by the game, and so it may ignore packets if they do not pass an up-to-date
check.

Commands that are not safely repeatable, such as "uncollect location" commands, should be marked out-of-date after executing and should not be executed if out-of-date.

### status.txt
* Game -> Client
* 10+ lines
* Communicates map data, communication information, and collected locations
* The client performs a version check on reading this packet and can send messages if there's a version mismatch
* Transmission number should be negative for the very first status on loading a mission

*List indices refer to packets in order of increasing bitmask (unlocks, locations, messages).
This means as new packet types are added, they get appended to the end of the list
and an outdated client can still work with older packet types.

### ping.txt
* Client -> Game
* Acknowledges status messages sent by the game
  * If this is not received within 2s of sending a status.txt packet,
    the communication channel should be considered unresponsive and the user notified with a text prompt
* Also lets the game know it should read other packets
* If the game has an unset world ID (-1), then should adopt world ID as its game ID.
  * Otherwise, if game ID doesn't match, should print a warning and no-op
