# Design Ideas
## TODO
* Get communication working at all
* Basic items (unit unlocks, hero levels, send items)
* Get saves working (may involve some kind of rewind / client-based memory)
* Crazier hero customization / abilities
* Permanent Items
* Consumables
* Runes

## Heroes
### Abilities
Possibilities:
* Each ability is assigned to a random hero, only useful in the missions that hero appears
* Abilities are assignable to heroes
* Abilities are locked to a hero, but when you get them, they are assignable to a mission
* Items are general (ie "ability 2") and all heroes benefit from it
* Assignable ability points that must be allocated in special UI

### Hero slots
#### Consistent slots
* Each hero slot gets randomized. So if Arthas gets rando'd to Tyrande, he will be Tyrande in all human campaign missions
* Alternate: hero slot rando. So Arthas can be Tyrande in Hu1 and Illidan in Hu2. Hero inventories are locked to slot (inspired by Arithon89 in GGG's Twitch chat)

#### Settings
> I would make the ability setting akin to:
> Vanilla: abilities are not random on your heroes
> Shuffle: Every hero gets 1 ultimate, and no more than one passive.
> Powerful: Each hero gets 5 slots instead of 4, otherwise similar to Shuffle. (I would make it 1 ultimate, 1 passive, 1 support, and 2 primary/secondary)
> Chaos: Anything is possible. 4 ultimates on one hero? 4 passives on another?
> Chaos+: Why not 5 ultimates on one hero?
